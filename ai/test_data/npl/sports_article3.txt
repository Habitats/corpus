Putting problems   What putting problems   Ernie Els looked like a different golfer on the greens at Harbour Town, in stark contrast to his struggles a week earlier at Augusta National. In that week, he went from having harrowing problems in the first two rounds of the Masters to actually leading the field in strokes gained putting over the weekend at the RBC Heritage. Editor's Picks Willett joins PGA Tour after Masters triumph Britain's Danny Willett has joined the PGA Tour following his victory at the Masters earlier this month. Four-Ball: Grace, DeChambeau prove points at Hilton Head What does the future hold for RBC Heritage champ Branden Grace   And can highly-touted (now former amateur) Bryson DeChambeau earn his PGA Tour card the hard way   Hey Augusta, how about hosting the Solheim Cup   Wouldn't it be great if Augusta National offered, in the spirit of progress, to host a Solheim Cup there   There's no doubt it would help grow the game and inspire more girls to pick up the sport. Golf can be a funny game. "I made huge mistakes last week," Els said after a final-round 66 at the Heritage helped him tie for 14th. "I haven't been doing that bad on the greens. And for some reason, Augusta week, always haunting you, trying to get better. ... I listened to somebody that I was maybe going a step forward. And it was just too quick. Just too much information to handle on those greens. And I absolutely had a big disaster. "I worked on it those two days that I played, but started feeling almost myself that last day. The last 10 holes, I started putting better and my anxiousness was gone. And this week you'll see my putting stats, I'm going to be top-20 in putting. It's there, I've just got to trust what I'm doing and just keep doing it."Els led the field in strokes gained putting over the weekend, a huge improvement from his 39-putt first-round effort (that included six-putting the first green) at the Masters, and was third for the week overall at the Heritage. 2. Plenty of support Els' peers took note of his dramatic improvement. A case of the yips is a curious malady that has struck many players over the years, and can be painful to watch, as many players wouldn't wish it on their fiercest rival. Count Luke Donald among those who gave props to the Big Easy. 3. Chasing those FedEx Cup riches Few were surprised when Masters champion Danny Willett announced he would be joining the PGA Tour. Winning any tournament gives a player automatic entry into the PGA Tour if he elects to take it, and even someone who has spent most of his time toiling on the European Tour has a hard time passing up the riches that come with playing for the FedEx Cup title. While the four-tournament playoff series is often criticized and might ultimately be reduced to a three-tournament series, it is hard for a player to turn their nose up at events that offer $8.5 million purses -- two of which have no cut -- plus the $30 million bonus pool, which includes $10 million to the overall winner. Willett gets 600 points retroactively for his Masters victory plus the 44 points he earned as a nonmember at the Valspar Championship. (Per tour regulations, points earned by a nonmember at the World Golf Championship events do not carry forward.) That puts him 27th in the current standings. 4. Playing for (big-time) pay Bryson DeChambeau started his pro career by tying for fourth at the RBC Heritage, which puts him in good position to earn a temporary PGA Tour membership. Jared C. Tilton Getty Images Bryson DeChambeau, 22, earned $259,600 in his pro debut at the RBC Heritage (he also signed several endorsement deals), but in the big picture, his tie for fourth is more about how it sets him up for the rest of the year. By finishing in the top 10, DeChambeau gets to save the sponsor exemption he was to receive this week in San Antonio. As a nonmember, he is only allowed seven exemptions, so he'll still have six to use while he's trying to earn more FedEx points than last season's 150th-place finisher. After getting 123 points, DeChambeau needs just 97 more to become a temporary member of the PGA Tour, which would let him accept unlimited invites; he can play a maximum of 12 times as a nonmember. The next goal for DeChambeau would be to finish among the top 125 money winners or FedEx Cup points earners. Last year, placing 125th required 455 points and approximately $747,000. He's well on his way to both totals, and accomplishing either would mean he is exempt in the 2016-17 season. By turning pro, however, the reigning U.S. Amateur champion foregoes his invite to the U.S. Open. He is registered for sectional qualifying at the Columbus, Ohio, location where he played his way into the field last year. 5. Returning to Car-nasty It is only fitting that Jean Van de Velde would make his senior debut at Carnoustie, the venue where he became famous for botching the 72nd hole with a three-shot lead in 1999, eventually losing in a playoff to Paul Lawrie. The Frenchman said this week he will play at the Scottish links this summer in the Senior Open Championship. The European Senior Tour did not miss the irony.
