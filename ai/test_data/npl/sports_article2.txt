LONDON — For just 11 minutes in the magnificent Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, it looked as if Benfica might roll back the clock to the early 1960s, when the Portuguese champion was a real force in European soccer. Benfica scored first Wednesday against Bayern Munich, and it should have scored a second time shortly thereafter. The stadium was rocking, the 63,235 fans were roaring, and even Munich’s finest players began to wonder if this was the end of its season in the Champions League. But then a shot of violent beauty from Munich’s Chilean midfielder, Arturo Vidal, tied the score. And because Bayern had won 1-0 in the first leg in Germany last week, it meant that Benfica had to score at least two more goals to get through to the semifinals because of the away-goal rule. The relief was palpable, but the contest wasn’t over. Thomas Müller stole a second goal for Bayern, and the Brazilian player Talisca then curled in a free kick for Benfica. While both sides went at it for more scores, the game finished 2-2, meaning that Bayern advanced to Friday’s semifinal draw along with Atlético Madrid, Real Madrid and Manchester City. There are many intrigues possible with the draw, with Coach Pep Guardiola either taking Bayern back to his native Spain or to England, to face the City team that he will manage next season. A manager, though, doesn’t experience the physical and emotional thrill of playing to a full house on a balmy Lisbon evening. “The stadium lived up to its reputation; the atmosphere was superb,” Müller told reporters afterward. “The match was intense and very closely fought at times. Benfica proved they can do what we’ve always insisted they could. It was no walk in the park, but over all we were the better team, and we went through deservedly.” That is his opinion, and once Vidal struck his goal in the 38th minute, it was a thoroughly justified one. However, the Eagles of Benfica, despite missing key players in defense and on attack, were not so easily grounded. Raúl Jiménez, a tall, mobile forward from Mexico, was leading the home team’s attack in place of the injured Nicolás Gaitán and the suspended Jonas. He put Benfica in front with a spectacular goal that went against the flow of play and punctured Bayern’s air of might. Eliseu turned defense into attack for Benfica with a 30-yard pass, curling it behind the opponents’ defenses like a quarterback throwing a ball. Jiménez bravely and accurately met it with his head from a dozen yards out. That pass and header took three Bayern players out of the equation — the defenders David Alaba and Javi Martínez almost collided, while the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer rushed off his line and punched thin air. Jiménez kept his eye on the ball, and his header looped into an empty net.

But two minutes later, Jiménez failed to instantly control a low cross and was hurried into a tame shot straight at a relieved Neuer from much closer. Five minutes after that, Vidal’s master stroke effectively put Bayern into the semifinals. Vidal, purchased from Juventus after the Italian team’s run to the final last season, often appears to be in a race between energetic brilliance and temperamental volatility. But Guardiola trusted Vidal to the extent that he left his leading scorer, Robert Lewandowski, out of the starting lineup, figuring that Bayern could win the game on the counterattack, with players bursting into space from midfield and without a conventional center forward. Vidal and Müller would exploit that space. First was Vidal, with a shot from a central position just outside the penalty box with such power that it hit the net before Ederson, Benfica’s Brazilian goalkeeper, could even move. Müller then scored, as he so often does, with the instinct of a poacher as he finished off a rehearsed corner-kick routine, in which Xabi Alonso hit the ball deep and Martínez headed it down. Benfica fell for that trick, but how could a home team lie down with a crowd as inspiring as theirs? Coach Rui Vitória had found a tactic for every situation in Europe up to this point, and, while acknowledging that Bayern is one of the most powerful teams in the world, he wasn’t lacking in guile on Wednesday. He rang up his changes and sent in his substitutes. After 77 minutes, one of them, Talisca, curled in his cunning free kick. For the second time in the night, Neuer looked less and less like his reputation as the world’s No.1 keeper. He misjudged that kick and was deceived again by the same player when Talisca swerved another free kick just wide of the other post. Bayern had been in a match that Guardiola warned his players to expect. But Lisbon is behind them now, and the coach can win the same treble — German league, German Cup and Champions League — that Guardiola’s predecessor, Jupp Heynckes, did before handing over the reins to Guardiola in 2013. The prospect that Guardiola’s Munich could be drawn against Barcelona, the club that made him and last year’s Champions League winner, is gone after the Catalan team was eliminated Wednesday by Atlético Madrid. No club has ever won the Champions Cup in successive seasons since its inception in 1992, and this season will be no different.
