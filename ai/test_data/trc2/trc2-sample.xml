<HEADLINE>REITs hailed success, despite share price woes</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  By Jennifer Hill LONDON, Jan 1 (Reuters) - New property investment vehicles were hailed a success on Tuesday, a year after their
  inception, despite share prices tumbling around 40 percent. More than 75 percent of Britain's major listed property companies converted to
  real estate investment trust (REIT) status during 2007. There are currently 17 UK REITs with a total market capitalisation of more than 25
  billion pounds. The REITs regime exempted eligible quoted property companies from corporation tax, ending the double taxation of the
  sector and making it attractive to investors who want to hold tax-efficient indirect property investments in their portfolios. A minimum
  percentage of investments in these closed-end vehicles, typically around three-quarters, must be held in rental-income producing real
  estate assets. REITS must distribute 90 percent of their income, which might be taxable in the hands of investors. However, a torrid year
  for property share prices has severely dented the investment trusts, wiping an average of around 40 percent off their value. The share
  price of all 17 UK REITs declined in value during the year, according to data from the sector's campaign body Reita. Programme
  co-ordinator Dave Butler said: 'UK REITs have been a real success, even despite significant market volatility which has hit the property
  and many other stock market sectors in the past year. 'Property is, and should be about, long-term investment for income and growth, not
  just about short-term prices. 'The ability of REITs to provide long-term predictable income is a major attraction for investors and the
  benefit of liquidity, that is inherent in the REIT structure, is becoming ever more obvious.' The EPRA UK real estate index gave a total
  return of 35.5 percent per annum between 2003 and 2006 -- a figure that hit 48 percent in 2006. Patrick Sumner, chairman of Reita, said
  low interest rates, strong rental growth and the anticipation of UK REITs led prices to overshoot, which led to 'some sharp profit-taking'
  at the start of 2007. 'The fall in property share prices in 2007 has to be seen in the context of strong, in retrospect excessive,
  performance in the previous four years,' he said. '2007 was just one year in an infinite future for the UK REITs regime and we shouldn't
  judge it on the basis of one rather extraordinary year.' The body expects investors to return to the UK commercial property market and
  yields to stabilise this year. It also expects to see the launch of a number of new, specialist REITs. (Editing by Steve Addison)

<HEADLINE>Malta joins euro zone</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  By Chris Scicluna VALLETTA, Jan 1 (Reuters) - The Mediterranean island of Malta became the smallest member of the euro zone at the stroke
  of midnight on Tuesday. The former British colony of some 400,000 people qualified for euro adoption after cutting its budget deficit from
  almost 10 percent of gross domestic product in 2003 to just over 2 percent. It successfully overcame a last-minute struggle to rein in
  inflation caused by galloping oil prices, and in November Malta's annual inflation rate, at 2.9 percent, was running slightly below the
  euro zone average of 3.1 percent. A Euro Changeover Committee has successfully allayed fears of inflation caused by euro adoption by
  reaching price-freeze agreements with most importers and retailers. Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi and Malta Central Bank Governor Michael
  Bonello crowned the moment by withdrawing euro banknotes from an ATM. 'This is a historic day in the life of the country and if we face up
  to the challenge and exploit the new opportunities which monetary union offers, the step we are taking today should lead to stronger, more
  sustainable economic growth,' said Bonello. Malta and fellow Mediterranean island Cyprus became the 14th and 15th countries to enter the
  euro zone, having joined the European Union in 2004 with eight other countries. Malta's exchange rate has been fixed at 0.43 lira to the
  euro since it joined the European exchange rate mechanism in May 2005. Euro zone states are Malta's most important trading partners and
  euro adoption is seen benefiting its large tourism sector. The opposition Labour Party, which had opposed EU membership for Malta, backed
  euro adoption and a public information campaign has been a widely acknowledged success. (Editing by Michael Winfrey)

<HEADLINE>WRAPUP 2-US candidates hone message; Huckabee pulls ad</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  By Deborah Charles PERRY, Iowa, Dec 31 (Reuters) - White House hopefuls honed their closing messages and traded jabs over their records in
  Iowa on Monday, three days before the state opens the presidential nominating battle in a too-close-to-call race. The leading contenders
  in both parties traded shots as a tight Iowa campaign ticked down to the end. Republican Mike Huckabee said he would not air an
  advertisement he prepared attacking rival Mitt Romney -- then showed it to reporters. Democrat Hillary Clinton said she was better suited
  to tackle special interests in Washington than rival John Edwards, a former North Carolina senator who has made that issue the centerpiece
  of his campaign. 'It's easy to talk about taking on special interests,' the New York senator and former first lady said in Keokuk, Iowa.
  'I've taken on the oil companies and I intend to keep doing it. It's something you don't have to do by yelling and screaming. Save your
  energy. Get the job done.' Polls show tight races in both parties in Iowa, which kicks off the state-by-state battle to choose candidates
  in the November presidential election. A Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll gave Clinton, seeking to be the first woman U.S. president, a
  four-point lead among Democrats over Edwards and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, who were tied for second. Among Republicans, former Arkansas
  Gov. Huckabee narrowly led former Massachusetts Gov. Romney by two points. The Democratic caucuses -- in which people gather in locations
  around the state to publicly declare support for their choices -- begin at 6:30 p.m. CST/0030 GMT on Thursday and Republicans start 30
  minutes later. Results begin appearing within a few hours. All of the top Democrats argued they would be the most electable in the
  November 2008 election, and targeted undecided voters as they geared up mammoth operations to get out the vote on Thursday. 'If you will
  stand with me on January 3 and caucus with me, we can change the world,' Obama told a crowd in Perry in central Iowa. Polls showed many
  Iowans in both parties were undecided or open to changing their minds. A Democratic caucus rule allowing supporters of candidates who fail
  to gather 15 percent of support in a given precinct to switch to another candidate increased the uncertainty. 'FLUID RACE' 'There is a
  remarkable amount of fluidity in this race right now and a lot of undecideds,' David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager, told reporters. He
  said all signs pointed to a large Democratic turnout on Thursday, which could be good for Obama and his effort to attract first-time
  caucus participants. The record Democratic turnout in 2004 was just more than 120,000. Romney has spent the last few days airing ads
  attacking Huckabee's record on immigration, taxes and crime in Arkansas. Huckabee, a Baptist minister, has fired back with questions about
  Romney's honesty and suitability for the White House. But he said he decided not to air a television ad that he prepared on Sunday in
  hopes of making the campaign more positive but then showed a portion of it to reporters. 'I just feel that we need to change the tone of
  the debate,' he told reporters, standing before a large poster that said 'Enough is enough' and flanked by signs attacking Romney's
  record. Romney said the mixed message was confusing. 'On the one hand he says he wants to run

<HEADLINE>Venezuela's Chavez grants amnesty in coup</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  CARACAS, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Monday he will pardon opponents accused of participating in a coup
  that ousted him briefly five years ago, a conciliatory move after a stinging electoral defeat this month. Chavez said he would publish the
  law in a day or so to show the government did not persecute its pollical rivals. 'We want the path of peace. We want heated ideological
  and political debate but in peace,' he said on state television. It was not immediately clear how may people would benefit from the
  amnesty, which also wipes the legal slate for people involved in a shutdown of the South American nation's vital oil industry and smaller
  attacks on the government. The left-wing Chavez has long faced fierce opposition from middle-class and wealthy sectors of society who have
  been sidelined by his policies, which are focused on the poor who make up the bulk of his supporters. In 2002, a group of military
  officers and businessmen orchestrated a coup to force Chavez from power but he was reinstated days later after massive street marches in
  his favor. Chavez opponents say people jailed for crimes related to the coup are political prisoners and accuse his government of
  persecuting those who signed a document supporting the short-live defacto rulers. Chavez spent much of 2007 working on a political reform
  that would have allowed him to run for re-election indefinitely and given him sweeping powers to build a socialist state. The plan was
  rejected in a referendum earlier this month. The opposition has since called for reconciliation. The outspoken U.S.-critic is a former
  para-trooper who himself tried to take office through a failed coup in 1992. He was imprisoned and later pardoned and was elected
  president in 1999. (Reporting by Frank Jack Daniel; editing by Bill Trott) ((frank.daniel@reuters.com; +58 212 277 2656; Reuters

<HEADLINE>UPDATE 2-Bush signs into law Sudan divestment measure</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  (Adds further White House comment in paragraphs 7-9.) By Jeremy Pelofsky CRAWFORD, Texas, Dec 31 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush
  on Monday signed into a law a measure aimed at allowing states, local governments, mutual funds and pension funds to divest from Sudan
  businesses, particularly its oil sectors. Some 20 U.S. states have initiated divestment efforts because of the conflict in Sudan's Darfur
  region, which has taken some 200,000 lives and displaced some 2.5 million since rebels took up arms against the government in 2003. But
  the effort in Illinois was challenged in court so the new law seeks to provide a legal framework for divestment from companies involved in
  Sudan's oil industry, mineral extraction, power production, and the production of military equipment. Bush has called the deaths in the
  Darfur conflict genocide, a charge the Sudanese government has rejected. 'My administration will continue its efforts to bring about
  significant improvements in the conditions in Sudan through sanctions against the government of Sudan and high-level diplomatic engagement
  and by supporting the deployment of peacekeepers in Darfur,' Bush said in a statement. But at the same time, he argued some provisions of
  the new law could interfere with his ability to conduct foreign policy and therefore he would 'construe and enforce this legislation in a
  manner that does not conflict with that authority.' White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said the administration would review divestment
  policies adopted by states and local governments to ensure they are consistent with the president's foreign policy and take action if
  necessary. 'If faced with an impediment to implementing a consistent, national foreign policy, the executive branch will take all
  appropriate and legal actions available,' he said. But Stanzel stressed that Bush signed the measure because 'the president broadly agrees
  with the aim of the sponsors, that doing business with Sudan should be discouraged.' The administration's position drew a strong rebuke
  from the spokeswoman for the chief sponsor of the new law, Sen. Chris Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat and a long-shot 2008 presidential
  hopeful. 'Up to this point, this administration's Sudan policy has been sorely lacking,' said Dodd spokeswoman Jamie Radice. 'An attempt
  by the president to step away from the letter and spirit of this law would amount to an acquiescence in genocide.' The new law also
  requires the State and Treasury Departments to report to Congress on the effectiveness of sanctions on Sudan. Contractors doing business
  with the U.S. government will have to certify that they are not involved in those areas as well. Bush signed the law at his Texas ranch
  where he was spending a weeklong holiday. The Save Darfur Coalition says the Sudanese government uses up to 70 percent of its oil
  revenues, generated mainly through foreign direct investment, to give arms and supplies to the Janjaweed militia accused of the killings
  in Darfur. Activists have pressed investors to divest their holdings in companies such as Malaysia's state-owned Petronas [PETR.UL],
  India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd<ONGC.BO>, and PetroChina Co Ltd<0857.HK>, whose parent company, China National Petroleum Corp, is
  helping Sudan drill for oil. (Editing by Doina Chiacu and Cynthia Osterman) ((jeremy.pelofsky@reuters.com; +1 20

<HEADLINE>UPDATE 2-Qualcomm barred from using Broadcom 3G patents</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  (Recasts; changes headline; adds details from ruling, byline) By Gina Keating LOS ANGELES, Dec 31 (Reuters) - A federal judge in
  California ruled on Monday that wireless chip maker Qualcomm Inc
  <QCOM.O>
  must immediately stop selling third-generation, or 3G, WCDMA cellular chips that infringe on the Broadcom Corp
  <BRCM.O>
  patents. U.S. District Judge James Selna ruled, however, that Qualcomm can keep selling some chips whose designs infringe three patents
  held by rival Broadcom through January 2009. Qualcomm also is restricted to selling only cellular chips it was offering as of May 29, 2007
  -- when a Santa Ana, California jury found that it infringed on the Broadcom patents -- and only to customers it had as of that date. A
  Qualcomm spokeswoman said the company's attorneys were reviewing the ruling and had no immediate comment. In a statement, Broadcom General
  Counsel David Dull said the company was 'pleased with today's ruling.' 'Broadcom should not have to compete against companies that use
  Broadcom's own patented technology against us, and this injunction puts a stop to Qualcomm doing just that,' Dull said. WCDMA mobile
  wireless technology provides much higher data speeds to mobile and portable wireless devices than most North American networks. Qualcomm
  also must pay mandatory royalties to Broadcom for the chips it sells during the 'sunset period' ending Jan. 31, 2009. The judge set
  royalties at 6 percent for a patent covering video compression for mobile phones and at 4.5 percent for another covering simultaneous
  communications between different types of networks. He ordered Broadcom and Qualcomm to negotiate a royalty for a third patent covering
  walkie-talkie-style technology or be prepared to brief the court on an appropriate royalty at a Feb. 29, 2008 hearing. Sprint Nextel Corp
  <S.N>
  plans to put that feature, which it called QChat, in phones in the first quarter of 2008 using Qualcomm chips. Selna ruled that after the
  'sunset' date, Qualcomm is permanently barred from infringing the three Broadcom patents. Broadcom had asked the judge to impose 18-month
  mandatory license fees for two of the infringed patents for a limited set of Qualcomm products and to bar Qualcomm from selling chips used
  for the QChat feature. Qualcomm had offered to pay three times the amount of a 'reasonable royalty' so that it could continue using
  Broadcom's patented technology with no injunction. Selna also ordered the companies to file a joint report before the February hearing
  about how they plan to handle Qualcomm's attempts to 'design around' the infringing chips. (Reporting by Gina Keating, editing by Richard

<HEADLINE>FEATURE-Golf-Time for tee on the Ponte Vecchio</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  By Norman Dabell FLORENCE, Italy, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Top golfers are used to pursuing their handsome living in all parts of the globe but
  the International Approach Championship provides an unusual setting even for these hardened travellers. Set in Florence, the event had an
  elite field of players from 16 countries contesting a relatively meagre first prize of $25,000 in a form of target golf from surely the
  sport's most outlandish tee location -- the ancient Ponte Vecchio. Built in 1345 and used for centuries by a wide variety of traders, the
  bridge now attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the historic Italian city every year. According to local tradition, the
  concept of bankruptcy originated on the Ponte Vecchio. Traders who could no longer pay their taxes had the table on which they sold their
  wares (il banco) broken (rotto) -- hence banco-rotto (bankrupt) -- so they could trade no more. Led by twice U.S. Masters champion
  Bernhard Langer, the purveyors of golfing skills on view for the International Approach Championship of 2007 in December, were in no
  danger of having their staples of business broken by anyone -- except themselves, perhaps, from frustration. The tournament was conceived
  by Romano Boretti, who runs the Conte of Florence clothing company and wanted do something spectacular for Florence from the new
  millennium. He thought of playing golf shots off the battlements of the old bridge and over seven years the event grew in popularity to
  become the international attraction it is now. CAMERA FLASHES The rules of the tournament were simple but provided a fiendishly awkward
  golfing challenge which attracted a field also including 2002 U.S. PGA champion Rich Beem to chilly Florence while the rest of their
  counterparts were roasting chestnuts by a roaring fire or soaking up the sun somewhere. The players were challenged with hitting
  20-ft-square greens a distance of 50 to 140 metres on the River Arno from the famous old bridge. Difficult enough and not assisted by the
  hundreds of pre-Christmas sightseers who often failed to observe traditional golf etiquette of silence while the ball was struck. Indeed
  many of the spectators even allowed their camera flashes to go off during the golfers' back-swing, a crime usually punished by a frogmarch
  off the course during a more routine tournament. Langer and his opponents barely turned a hair. The German is the epitome of concentration
  and even a pre-event carriage ride which went awry when the horse bolted a short distance failed to upset his equilibrium. He progressed
  to the semi-finals but took defeat there in his stride. 'The family and me are taking a skiing holiday in Italy before spending Christmas
  in Germany and we thought it would be nice to stop off in Florence first. You always want to do well, though, in anything you do,' he told
  Reuters. Briton David Lynn and Swiss Andre Bossert reached the final in temperatures of minus-three Celsius where the latter's decision to
  wear three layers of clothes paid dividends with eventual victory. 'I guess you can call me a bridge specialist now,' Bossert told
  Reuters. (Editing by Jon Bramley) ((jonathan.bramley@reuters.com; +44 207 542 7934; reuters messaging:

<HEADLINE>UPDATE 1-U.S. and Britain pressure Kenya over disputed poll</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  (Adds Amnesty International statement) By Daniel Wallis NAIROBI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - The United States and Britain pressed Kenya to
  investigate possible voting irregularities in an election that returned President Mwai Kibaki to power and triggered rioting in which more
  than 100 people have died. The death toll appeared certain to rise after Kibaki's disputed victory in East Africa's biggest economy.
  International observers who initially hailed the poll as an example for the continent expressed serious concerns about the vote-counting
  and abhorred the nationwide clashes that followed. The United States said on Monday disputes over the poll should be resolved through
  'constitutional and legal remedies' and that it was working with all parties to avoid more violence. 'All sides should exercise and work
  for a solution that reflects the will of the Kenyan people,' said a spokesman for British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who spoke to Kibaki
  and opposition leader Raila Odinga and urged them to work together. Reuters estimates about 100 people have been killed, based on
  witnesses, body counts and credible media reports of the battles between police and machete-wielding protesters. Residents said bodies
  still lay on some streets of Kisumu, a city in the opposition's western heartland. Local television station KTN said the nationwide toll
  had reached at least 124. The violence in the capital Nairobi, the Indian Ocean resort of Mombasa and many smaller towns put investment in
  the economy at risk and dented Kenya's image as a haven of relative stability in an often dangerous region. U.N. Secretary-General Ban
  Ki-moon deplored the bloodshed and urged security forces to show the utmost restraint. Amnesty International called for an independent
  inquiry into the killings. 'The government should ensure its security forces comply with international standards on the use of lethal
  force against demonstrators,' the rights group said in a statement. KIBAKI MESSAGE In a New Year message, Kibaki urged reconciliation but
  promised to deal decisively with any troublemakers. Much of the fighting has pitted members of his Kikuyu ethnic group, Kenya's largest
  and most economically dominant tribe, against Luo supporters of opposition leader Raila Odinga. As many people stayed at home in fear,
  most businesses remained closed and supplies of food, fuel and water ran low. The worst violence has been in Kisumu, where witnesses said
  police fired on protesters when riots erupted on Sunday. On Monday, 21 bodies lay at a Kisumu mortuary. Most had gunshot wounds. Verifying
  the toll was hard because reporters were barred by a man who said he was a government employee. The government said it would not declare a
  state of emergency or any curfews, and would not deploy the military. 'Police are handling the matter and the government expects the
  situation to normalise in the next few days,' a statement said. Odinga, who says he is Kenya's elected leader, has called for a million
  supporters to gather for a rally in a central Nairobi park on Thursday. Both sides have accused the other of blatant rigging during the
  Dec. 27 poll, which passed off peacefully. Early tallies showed Odinga ahead but official final results that were delayed three days
  showed Kibaki winning narrowly. Chief European Union monitor Alexander Graf Lambsdorff said t

<HEADLINE>UPDATE 3-Bush signs into law Sudan divestment measure</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  (Adds Dodd, Darfur advocacy groups comment) By Jeremy Pelofsky CRAWFORD, Texas, Dec 31 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush on Monday
  signed into a law a measure aimed at allowing states, local governments, mutual funds and pension funds to divest from Sudan businesses,
  particularly its oil sectors. Some 20 U.S. states have initiated divestment efforts because of the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region,
  which has taken some 200,000 lives and displaced some 2.5 million since rebels took up arms against the government in 2003. But the effort
  in Illinois was challenged in court so the new law seeks to provide a legal framework for divestment from companies involved in Sudan's
  oil industry, mineral extraction, power production and the production of military equipment. Bush has called the deaths in the Darfur
  conflict genocide, a charge the Sudanese government has rejected. 'My administration will continue its efforts to bring about significant
  improvements in the conditions in Sudan through sanctions against the government of Sudan and high-level diplomatic engagement and by
  supporting the deployment of peacekeepers in Darfur,' Bush said in a statement. But at the same time, he argued some provisions of the new
  law could interfere with his ability to conduct foreign policy and therefore he would 'construe and enforce this legislation in a manner
  that does not conflict with that authority.' White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said the administration would review divestment policies
  adopted by states and local governments to ensure they are consistent with the president's foreign policy and take action if necessary.
  But Stanzel stressed that Bush signed the measure because 'the president broadly agrees with the aim of the sponsors, that doing business
  with Sudan should be discouraged.' STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION The chief sponsor of the new law, Sen. Chris Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat
  and long-shot 2008 presidential hopeful, said the divestment is a vital step in the right direction. 'As we enter the new year, I urge
  states and local governments, as well as private investors, to take action, exercise your rights under this law and stop the genocide in
  Darfur,' Dodd said. The new law also requires the State and Treasury Departments to report to Congress on the effectiveness of sanctions
  on Sudan. Contractors doing business with the U.S. government will have to certify they are not involved in those areas as well. Bush
  signed the law at his Texas ranch where he was spending a weeklong holiday. The Save Darfur Coalition and other advocacy groups hailed the
  signing and urged Bush to ensure the law is enforced. 'The people of Darfur cannot afford an empty 'law on the books,' which is why the
  president must vigorously enforce this critical legislation,' the groups said in a joint statement. The coalition says the Sudanese
  government uses up to 70 percent of its oil revenues, generated mainly through foreign direct investment, to give arms and supplies to the
  Janjaweed militia accused of the killings in Darfur. Activists have pressed investors to divest their holdings in companies such as
  Malaysia's state-owned Petronas [PETR.UL], India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd<ONGC.BO>, and PetroChina Co Ltd<0857.HK>, whose parent
  company, China National Petroleum Corp, is helping Sudan drill for oil. (Editing by

<HEADLINE>UPDATE 1-NFL-Ravens sack Billick after disappointing season</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  (changes datelines, adds details, quotes) BALTIMORE, Maryland, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The Baltimore Ravens sacked long-time head coach Brian
  Billick on Monday, a day after finishing a disappointing 5-11 season. The 53-year-old Billick won a Super Bowl with the Ravens following
  the 2000 season but the club went on to win only one playoff game over the next seven years. Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said the firing
  'was in the Ravens' best interest'. 'He (Billick) was very gracious to me when we met today,' Bisciotti told a news conference. 'He
  understood, at least gave me the confidence that I was true to go with my gut. 'I believed it was time for a change. I believe that we
  have the nucleus of a team that can get back to the Super Bowl and we felt that in the next five years we'd have a better chance with a
  new coach.' Billick had spent nine seasons in Baltimore and was the Ravens' most successful coach with an 85-67 record. 'It has been a
  great ride with the Ravens and the fans here,' Billick said in a statement. 'The passion, the dedication and the willingness to work by
  the players is so appreciated. Even in this difficult season, they fought through it. 'My respect for the players, every single one who
  has played for the Ravens in the last nine years, is hard to articulate. They have my complete respect and admiration.' Billick was
  brought to Baltimore from Minnesota where he was the offensive coordinator. However, it was the Ravens' defense that led them to the Super
  Bowl and Billick was often criticized for the team's lagging offense. One year after winning the AFC North with a 13-3 record, the Ravens
  struggled this season, losing a team record nine consecutive games before a season-ending 27-21 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers on
  Sunday. 'He gets a disproportionate amount of blame for the position that we're in,' Bisciotti said of Billick. 'We are collectively a
  5-11 team.' Bisciotti denied reports he was talking with former Steelers coach Bill Cowher, who won the Super Bowl following the 2005
  campaign, to succeed Billick. 'I have never met Bill Cowher,' he said. 'I have not spent one minute thinking about Brian's replacement.'

<HEADLINE>Japan births fell in 2007, ageing trend on track</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  TOKYO, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Japan is expected to report fewer babies born in 2007, a government report said on Tuesday, kicking off the new
  year with a bleak reminder of the long-term risks the economy faces as its population ages at an unprecedented pace. Japan's rock-bottom
  birth rate has raised concerns about a shrinking workforce, slower economic growth and troubles ahead for government efforts to fund its
  ballooning pension needs. The Health Ministry report, based on preliminary figures of births and deaths registered at Japanese municipal
  offices, estimated the number of babies born in 2007 was likely to have fallen by 3,000 from a year earlier to 1,090,000. The decline
  would follow an increase in babies in 2006, the first rise in six years, which was attributed to a rise in marriages helped by an
  improving economy. A ministry official said both births and Japan's population of 128 million were likely to decline in coming years,
  given the outlook for a decline in the number of women able to bear children. 'The number of babies will probably fall or steady going
  forward while the number of deaths will rise,' she said. 'So the long-term trend is for the population to decline.' The same report
  estimated the number of deaths in 2007 rose by 22,000 to 1,106,000. Japan's fertility rate, or the average number of children a woman
  bears in her lifetime, stood at 1.32 in 2006, far from an estimated 2.07 needed to keep a population from falling. Experts say Japan has
  lagged countries such as Sweden and the United States in helping parents balance work and family. Long working hours, late-night business
  meetings and the high cost of child care have all put couples off having babies. The phenomenon threatens to squeeze the economy by
  shrinking the labour force and leaving fewer workers to support a growing number of pensioners. Separate government data last year showed
  a tenth of Japan's population was aged 75 or older, a historical high, while another report showed the proportion of those 65 or older
  would double to 40 percent by mid-century. (Reporting by Chisa Fujioka; editing by Roger Crabb) ((chisa.fujioka@reuters.com; +81-3

<HEADLINE>UPDATE 6-Colombian hostage rescue deal crumbles</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  (Adds envoys left, helicopters staying in Colombia) By Nelson Bocanegra VILLAVICENCIO, Colombia, Dec 31 (Reuters) - A delicate mission to
  free three hostages held by Colombian guerrillas appeared to collapse on Monday as the government and rebel leaders accused each other of
  trying to kill the deal. The Venezuela-led plan to pick up two women hostages and a child born to one of them in captivity has been
  repeatedly delayed since last Thursday and rebel leaders said intense army operations in the jungle region made it impossible for now. 'In
  these conditions it would put in grave risk the lives of these people to free them,' the rebels said in a letter sent to Venezuela's
  left-wing President Hugo Chavez, who had negotiated the deal for the release of the three hostages. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe
  rejected the allegation and accused rebel commanders of inventing excuses. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, promised
  earlier this month to deliver the three to Chavez, and he sent two helicopters to this town deep inside Colombia last Friday to pick them
  up. Chavez read out the FARC's letter explaining its failure to say where the hostages were, and he accused Uribe of sabotaging his rescue
  plan. 'Uribe went to dynamite the third phase of this operation,' Chavez said, adding that independent reports also pointed to an
  intensification of Colombian military activity in the area. Foreign envoys, including former Argentine President Nestor Kirchner, had gone
  to Colombia to help the mission but flew back to Caracas on Monday night, although Chavez said his helicopters would stay. 'Unless we are
  thrown out of Colombia, we will stay,' he said, adding that he was in contact with the guerrillas and still hoped they would tell him
  where the hostages were. Uribe, a conservative who has clashed repeatedly with Chavez, denied military operations had prevented the
  handover. 'The FARC terrorist group has no excuses. They have always used excuses to deceive Colombia and now they want to deceive the
  international community. They are lying,' he said in the central city of Villavicencio, where the Venezuelan helicopters waited to be
  dispatched for the handover. He offered, however, to halt army patrols in an area designated by the FARC once they reveal the location of
  their captives. The three hostages are Consuelo Gonzalez, Clara Rojas and her son Emmanuel, who was fathered by a rebel fighter and is
  thought to be four years old. BORN IN REBEL CAMP Uribe, whose father was killed by rebels, suggested the FARC had backed off because they
  no longer have Rojas's son, saying a child fitting his description was turned over to child welfare authorities and is living in the
  capital city Bogota. He said the child showed marks of torture. Rojas was kidnapped during her 2002 vice presidential campaign and
  Gonzalez, a former lawmaker, was taken in 2001. In its letter to Chavez, the FARC said it was still committed to handing over the
  hostages. 'As soon as we can find a place that offers us security, we will be in touch to reactivate the mechanisms that will make
  possible the safe return of Clara, Emmanuel and Consuelo,' it said. Chavez, a fierce critic of the United States, had earlier speculated
  that radio interference by U.S. forces deployed in Colombia to back its war against the FARC and drug traffic

<HEADLINE>North Korea greets new year with nuclear silence</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  By Jon Herskovitz SEOUL, Jan 1 (Reuters) - North Korea gave no public explanation on Tuesday for its failure to meet a nuclear disarmament
  deadline, but promised a better standard of living for the citizens of the destitute communist state. Pyongyang, which uses newspaper
  editorials on New Year's Day to lay out its policy priorities for the year to come, referred only directly to its nuclear arms programme
  while focusing on 'building a prosperous nation'. 'The entire (communist) party, the whole country and all the people should launch a
  general offensive to build an economic power,' it said in an editorial jointly published in its official media and carried in English by
  the official news agency. Pyongyang failed to meet a Dec. 31 deadline to give a full accounting of its nuclear arms programme, considered
  one of the region's greatest security threats, and answer U.S. suspicions of having a clandestine operation to enrich uranium for weapons.
  '(North Korea) will continue to make earnest efforts for stability on the Korean peninsula and peace in the world,' was about the closest
  it came to addressing the matter. Under a six-country deal, the reclusive North would receive 1 million tonnes of heavy fuel oil or
  equivalent aid and an end to its status as an international pariah in exchange for starting to take apart its plutonium-producing nuclear
  plant and providing a list of its atomic activities. The joint editorial called for modernising the North's anaemic economy, which is
  weaker now than it was 20 years ago and has been crippled by decades of mismanagement. TINY PERCENTAGE The North's GDP, estimated by
  Seoul's central bank at 21.2 trillion won ($22.6 billion), ranks close to that of war-torn Sri Lanka and is less than 3 percent of the
  South Korean economy. 'The people's-living-first policy should be pursued,' the joint editorial said in giving rare attention to the
  state's consumer sector. North Korea pledged to build more housing and develop light industries to make higher-quality consumer goods.
  'This policy reflects our Party's firm determination and will to make our people, who have pushed their way through trying ordeal and
  hardship, lead an affluent and cultured life.' North Korea pledged to develop ties with its southern neighbour. It said it would boost the
  mining, railway and chemical sectors while addressing its inability to grow enough food to feed its 23 million people. 'At present there
  is no more urgent and important task than solving the problem of food.' In typical fashion, it lauded the pillars of the state, such as
  its doctrine of juche (self-reliance) and the military-first 'songun' policy, as well as its revered leader, Kim Jong-il. 'The proud
  victories and successes we achieved last year in the political, military, economic, cultural, diplomatic and all other realms are
  brilliant fruition of leader Kim Jong-il's outstanding strategy and tactics, his iron will and his tireless leadership.' (Editing by Roger

<HEADLINE>China official Dec PMI falls to 55.3 vs 55.4 in Nov</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  BEIJING, Jan 1 (Reuters) - China's official purchasing managers' index fell to 55.3 in December from 55.4 in November, the China
  Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said on Tuesday. The association compiles the index on behalf of the National Bureau of Statistics.
  A reading over 50 indicates an expansion of activity, while one below 50 suggests contraction. Zhang Liqun, a researcher with the
  Development Research Centre, a think-tank that reports to China's cabinet, said that the relative stability in the PMI was seasonal in
  nature and that a recent easing in industrial output had yet to show up in it. 'Industrial output growth saw a modest easing in October
  and November, but investment growth picked up, indicating an acceleration in economic growth,' Zhang said in a commentary released by the
  logistics and purchasing association. 'We still need to do further observation and analysis on the seasonality of the PMI and its
  relationship to the rate of industrial output growth.' The sub-index for input prices fell to 69.0 from 70.1 in November, the association
  said, indicating a moderate deceleration in such inflation. The central bank raised interest rates six times and banks' reserve
  requirements 10 times in 2007 in an effort to prevent excess cash in the financial system from pouring into wasteful investments and
  pushing up the prices of goods and assets. Following is a breakdown of the purchasing managers' index: Dec Nov Oct Sep Aug Jul Overall PMI
  55.3 55.4 53.2 56.1 54.0 53.3 Output 59.5 60.1 54.9 61.7 57.1 55.7 New orders 59.6 59.4 56.4 60.7 56.3 56.0 New export orders 54.3 53.8

<HEADLINE>Olympics-China exudes optimism despite critical new report</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  By Ben Blanchard BEIJING, Jan 1 (Reuters) - China exuded optimism on Tuesday about the 2008 Beijing Olympics, saying its centuries of
  culture and history would light up the world, even as organisers came under renewed pressure to fulfil a media freedom pledge. 'We will
  show the world 5,000 years of splendid Chinese history, the significant achievements of modern China and the zeitgeist of the Chinese
  people,' said the Communist Party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, in a New Year's Day editorial. 'This is the year that 1.3 billion sons
  and daughters of China have been ardently expecting, the year when more of the world's gaze will be fixed on China, the year that will be
  etched into the history of the People's Republic,' it added. While recognising that unprecedented challenges lay ahead for the year as a
  whole, the editorial said that there would be far more opportunities than challenges. 'We are standing at a new starting point in
  history,' it said, just over eight months before the Games open in Beijing on Aug. 8. While the way ahead is expected to be anything but
  smooth sailing, the editorial did not allude to looming problems such as the pall of smog which still plagues Beijing or frequent foreign
  criticism of China's human rights record. Authorities are also well aware that groups such as Free Tibet campaigners or China's growing
  band of domestically dispossessed are hoping to use the Olympics to highlight their complaints in front of a massive global audience.
  PRESS HARASSMENT The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said on Monday that reporters were still being subjected to harassment,
  interference and even violence while doing their jobs, despite government promises to grant total press freedom. The group said there were
  'repeated violations' of temporary new regulations supposed to massively free up the reporting environment, including in such sensitive
  regions as Tibet and Xinjiang, although it added the new rules were a positive step. Foreign journalists are now allowed to interview
  anyone without first getting government permission, and to go pretty much anywhere in China, although Tibet remains largely off-limits.
  Domestic media are still tightly controlled. 'The FCCC hopes that as a lasting legacy of the Games, the regulations will be made
  permanent, and will be fully implemented nationwide, including in Tibet and Xinjiang,' it said in a statement. But China hit back at
  repeated censure of its human rights situation by the United States, European Union and pressure groups, releasing late on Monday via its
  official Xinhua news agency a series of pieces lauding progress. While Xinhua made no direct mention of the Games, Beijing has been
  subject to particular criticism for forcibly evicting residents to make way for Olympics-related projects, and for detaining dissidents it
  fears will embarrass China. 'Human rights, as a concept, have become a constitutional principle, a mainstream subject in the political
  life of both the Party and the state,' it quoted Dong Yunhu, vice president of the China Human Rights Research Association, as saying.

<HEADLINE>South Korea turns more cautious on 2008 economy</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  SEOUL, Jan 1 (Reuters) - South Korea's economy will probably expand by slightly less than the previously projected 5 percent in 2008 due
  to increased risks from the slowing global economy and firmer oil prices, Finance Minister Kwon O-kyu said. Kwon said in his New Year news
  conference, held late last week for publication on Tuesday, that Asia's fourth-largest economy would probably expand in 2008 by a similar
  pace as in 2007, but did not mention a specific rate. 'Our economy in 2008 is expected to grow close to 5 percent, similar to 2007, with
  the (year-on-year) growth rate standing higher in the first half than in the second,' Kwon said. The central bank estimated in early
  December that the economy expanded by a real 4.8 percent in 2007, above its original target of 4.4 percent set a year earlier but down
  from a 5.0 percent rise in 2006. He said export growth would slightly fall in 2008 due to a slowing global economy but construction
  investment growth would likely pick up, while private consumption and capital investment will grow at a similar pace as in 2007. Kwon said
  his ministry did not set a specific target for the gross domestic product growth mainly because a new government will take over in late
  February, when he and other top government officials are widely expected to be replaced. Conservative opposition candidate Lee Myung-bak,
  a former Hyundai Group executive, was elected as the country's president on Dec. 19 to rule the country of nearly 50 million people for a
  single five-year term from late February. He has promised to raise economic growth to 7 percent per year on average during the next 10
  years and lift per capita income to $40,000 from the current $20,000. South Korea's economy derives more than half of its annual output
  from private consumption but has relied heavily on exports for growth in recent years when consumer spending was growing only slowly.

<HEADLINE>Convalescing Castro sends Cubans New Year message</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  HAVANA, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Convalescing Cuban leader Fidel Castro on Monday sent a New Year's message telling Cubans to celebrate the
  anniversary of his 1959 revolution nearly 17 months after illness forced him to hand power to his brother. Castro, one of the few
  surviving Cold War enemies of the United States, has only appeared in taped videos and photographs since undergoing emergency stomach
  surgery in July 2006 and with his full condition a state secret it is unclear whether the 81-year-old will resume office. 'In the morning,
  49 years of the revolution will be behind us and the 50th year will symbolize half a century of heroic resistance,' Castro said in a
  statement read on television. 'We proclaim our pride in this record to the world.' Cuba's National Assembly may decide on Castro's post as
  head of state when it approves members of the executive Council of State in March. But his brother Raul's call for more open debate over
  problems has fueled speculation about the political and economic future of the island. His brother says Castro is lucid, consulted on
  major policy decisions and has recovered sufficient strength that party delegates support his nomination to run for a National Assembly
  seat, a requirement for the presidency. But Fidel Castro has hinted twice in recent statements he will not cling on to power or his formal
  posts, suggesting he will instead contribute with ideas drawn from his experience. Castro has been nominated for the assembly but if he is
  too ill, the assembly may formally appoint a successor. Fidel Castro holds posts of president of the Council of State and Council of
  Ministers and first secretary of the ruling Communist Party. Cuba watchers say a smooth transition of power already has taken place under
  Raul Castro, who some believe is a more practical manager who has begun talking about an open approach to handling the economic problems,
  including more foreign investment in the agriculture sector. (Reporting by Patrick Markey; Editing by Bill Trott)

<HEADLINE>Indian bond yields may fall on easier cash</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  MUMBAI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Indian federal bond yields could ease on Tuesday as traders expect fresh inflows in the coming days, which
  should help alleviate tight cash conditions and increase the funds available to invest in debt. * A cash squeeze in the banking system
  last month due to tax payments by companies sent overnight money rates<INROND=> up to around 8 percent, pushing banks to borrow at the
  central bank's daily money market window. * But government spending at the start of the month, bond redemptions of 105 billion rupees in
  early January, and central bank bond purchases from the market in December have brightened the cash outlook. * The 10-year bond yield
  <IN079917G=CC> ended at 7.79 percent on Monday, its lowest since July and below 7.81 percent on Friday.

  traders said the central bank could intervene to check the rupee's gains against the dollar. * Data showed foreign investors bought more

<HEADLINE>South Korea's Lee to invite North to inauguration</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  SEOUL, Jan 1 (Reuters) - South Korean President-elect Lee Myung-bak, who has pledged to act tough with North Korea, will ask the communist
  neighbour to send a representative to his inauguration in February, a Seoul news report said on Tuesday. North Korean media have made no
  mention of Lee, the conservative former mayor of Seoul who once ran the giant Hyundai conglomerate's construction arm, since he won the
  presidency on Dec. 19. A member of Lee's advance team told the Yonhap news agency Lee planned to send an envoy to North Korea to deliver
  an invitation to attend his Feb. 25 inauguration. '(The South) should send a special envoy to North Korea in January so that an official
  at least from the deputy premier level or higher can attend the presidential inauguration ceremony in February,' Korea University
  Professor Nam Sung-wook, a senior aide on North Korea policy, said in an interview. Lee has pledged to review the North Korea policy of
  outgoing President Roh Moo-hyun, criticised for being too soft on the communist state whose government has continued to develop nuclear
  weapons and maintained a dismal human rights record. 'There's no change in my belief that (the new government) should offer dialogue with
  North Korea,' Nam said. In his first news conference after the election, Lee called on the North to give up its nuclear weapons and
  improve the way it treats its citizens. North Korea bristles at any criticism of its rights record, widely seen as among the worst in the
  world. In the days following his election victory five years ago, Roh apparently angered Pyongyang by mentioning its human rights abuses.

  1845.00 billion rupees since the current financial year began on April 1. The government has issued 91-day treasury bills worth 570.00
  billion rupees, 182-days treasury bill worth 190.00 billion rupees, 364-day treasury bills worth 180 billion and bonds worth 930 billion
  rupees. Under the MSS scheme, the central bank issues bonds to soak up the additional cash in the banking system generated by its own
  intervention. Though it sells treasury bills under this scheme weekly, it resumed selling dated securities from March 2006 after a gap of
  nearly 18 months. According to the central bank's website, the total outstanding balance under the MSS stood at 1,626.65 billion rupees as
  on Dec 21, below a self-imposed limit of 2.35 trillion rupees. ------------------------------------------------------------- Sale Bond

<HEADLINE>RPT-Benchmark index futures premium narrows slightly</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  (Repeats story filed on Monday) MUMBAI, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The premium on the benchmark Nifty index futures narrowed slightly to the spot
  Nifty on the last day of trading in 2007 as holiday mood gripped the trading community, analysts said. 'People are on holiday,' said
  Sidharth Bhamre, derivatives analyst with Angel Broking. He said the Nifty's trading range would shift higher as more inflows come in. 'We
  see the trading range shift from 5600-5700 to 5900-6100,' he said, adding that the Nifty could face resistance at the 6150 level. The
  premium on the Nifty January futures
  <NIFc1>
  was 24.35 points to the 50-share NSE index<.NSEI>, compared with 38.6 points on Friday. The Nifty January futures closed up 44.65 points
  at 6162.95 while the spot index closed up 0.97 percent at 6138.6 points. The large caps and the mid-caps would continue to drive the
  market, analysts said. Short positions had been created in the large-cap stocks, while people were long in mid-caps. Buying put options
  against long futures would be an effective hedging strategy, Bhamre said. Data from the NSE site showed that among individual stock
  futures Reliance Industries
  <RELInsc1>

<HEADLINE>Obama widens lead over Clinton in Iowa poll</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  DES MOINES, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has widened his lead in Iowa over rivals Hillary Clinton and
  John Edwards heading into Thursday's caucuses, according to a poll by The Des Moines Register released on Monday. The Illinois senator was
  the choice of 32 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers, up from 28 percent in the Register's previous poll in late November, the
  newspaper reported. Clinton, a New York senator and former first lady, held steady at 25 percent and Edwards, a former North Carolina
  senator, was steady at 24 percent, the paper said. No other Democrat received support from more than 6 percent of likely caucusgoers,
  according to the poll. The Register said its final survey before the first of the crucial contests to decide the major party candidates
  for the November 2008 election reflects continued fluidity in the race even as the year-long campaign in the state nears an end. Roughly a
  third of likely caucusgoers said they could be persuaded to choose someone else before Thursday evening, the paper said. The telephone
  poll of 800 likely Democratic caucusgoers was taken Dec. 27 to 30 and the margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3.5 percentage
  points. (Editing by Todd Eastham) ((joanne.allen@.reuters.com; +1 202 898 8300; Reuters Messaging: joanne.allen.reuters.com@reuters.net))

<HEADLINE>China wartime aircraft plant to open as resort</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  BEIJING, Jan 1 (Reuters) - China is to create a tourist resort in a giant cave used by the former Nationalist government as a secret
  aircraft factory during World War Two, the official Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday. The Haikong cave, in verdant mountains near the
  southwestern city and wartime capital of Chongqing, will cost about 500 million yuan ($68 million) to develop, the report said. The cave
  is 'an ideal place for conferences and leisure travel', it said, citing the local investment bureau's Web site. 'The enshrouded cave is 50
  metres (164 ft) high and as spacious as a giant conference hall,' Xinhua added. 'The tourist bureau said that the manufacturing plant
  could be developed into a loft art workshop.' The plant was deserted in 1949, the report said, after the Nationalists fled to Taiwan after
  losing a brutal civil war with the Communists. ($1=7.303 Yuan) (Reporting by Ben Blanchard; editing by Roger Crabb)

<HEADLINE>REFILE-North Korea greets new year with nuclear silence</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  (Refiles to insert dropped letters in paragraph 2) By Jon Herskovitz SEOUL, Jan 1 (Reuters) - North Korea gave no public explanation on
  Tuesday for its failure to meet a nuclear disarmament deadline, but promised a better standard of living for the citizens of the destitute
  communist state. Pyongyang, which uses newspaper editorials on New Year's Day to lay out its policy priorities for the year to come,
  referred only indirectly to its nuclear arms programme while focusing on 'building a prosperous nation'. 'The entire (communist) party,
  the whole country and all the people should launch a general offensive to build an economic power,' it said in an editorial jointly
  published in its official media and carried in English by the official news agency. Pyongyang failed to meet a Dec. 31 deadline to give a
  full accounting of its nuclear arms programme, considered one of the region's greatest security threats, and answer U.S. suspicions of
  having a clandestine operation to enrich uranium for weapons. '(North Korea) will continue to make earnest efforts for stability on the
  Korean peninsula and peace in the world,' was about the closest it came to addressing the matter. Under a six-country deal, the reclusive
  North would receive 1 million tonnes of heavy fuel oil or equivalent aid and an end to its status as an international pariah in exchange
  for starting to take apart its plutonium-producing nuclear plant and providing a list of its atomic activities. The joint editorial called
  for modernising the North's anaemic economy, which is weaker now than it was 20 years ago and has been crippled by decades of
  mismanagement. TINY PERCENTAGE The North's GDP, estimated by Seoul's central bank at 21.2 trillion won ($22.6 billion), ranks close to
  that of war-torn Sri Lanka and is less than 3 percent of the South Korean economy. 'The people's-living-first policy should be pursued,'
  the joint editorial said in giving rare attention to the state's consumer sector. North Korea pledged to build more housing and develop
  light industries to make higher-quality consumer goods. 'This policy reflects our Party's firm determination and will to make our people,
  who have pushed their way through trying ordeal and hardship, lead an affluent and cultured life.' North Korea pledged to develop ties
  with its southern neighbour. It said it would boost the mining, railway and chemical sectors while addressing its inability to grow enough
  food to feed its 23 million people. 'At present there is no more urgent and important task than solving the problem of food.' In typical
  fashion, it lauded the pillars of the state, such as its doctrine of juche (self-reliance) and the military-first 'songun' policy, as well
  as its revered leader, Kim Jong-il. 'The proud victories and successes we achieved last year in the political, military, economic,
  cultural, diplomatic and all other realms are brilliant fruition of leader Kim Jong-il's outstanding strategy and tactics, his iron will
  and his tireless leadership.' (Editing by Roger Crabb) ((jon.herskovitz@reuters.com; +822 3704-5510;, Reuters Messaging:

  MUMBAI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Communication services firm Dhanus Technologies
  <DHAT.BO>
  is in advanced talks to buy the telecom unit of Turkey's Boursan Holdings, the Economic Times daily reported on Tuesday, citing sources
  close to the deal. Dhanus has emerged as the lead bidder, quoting more than 3 billion rupees for Boursan Telekom Corp, the paper said.
  Hutchison Whampoa<0013.HK> and a U.S. telecoms firm are the other bidders, it said. The acquisition, if it happens, will be a leveraged
  buyout with ICICI Bank
  <ICBK.BO>
  being the lead lender, the paper said. Dhanus Technologies officials could not be reached for comment. 'We are scouting for acquisitions
  in the European market. Talks are on with various firms. We cannot comment on individual deals,' the paper quoted Dhanus' vice-chairman S.
  Muthukrishnan as saying. KPMG has completed the due diligence on Boursan Telekom for Dhanus, it said. (Reporting by Narayanan

<HEADLINE>Indian shares to open 2008 with record high in reach</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  MUMBAI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Indian shares are 1 percent away from a record high and a confident market may try to test the peak on Tuesday,
  but cues from overseas will be limited as most markets are shut for the New Year's Day holiday. The benchmark 30-share BSE index<.BSESN>
  closed 0.4 percent higher at 20,286.99 points on Monday, and is now just 1 percent away from its Dec. 13 record high of 20,498.11. The
  stock market rose 47.1 percent in 2007, its strongest growth in four years, just ahead of a 46.7 percent rise in 2006. 'The index overall
  could be range bound and the market will continue to trade the way it did on Monday,' said Ambareesh Baliga, vice president at Karvy Stock
  Broking Ltd. 'The action in mid- and small-cap stocks may take it to a record high,' he said. Analysts expect the market to rise in 2008,
  but at a slower pace than last year. A possible moderation in the growth of company earnings, the risk of a U.S. slowdown and maintaining
  record overseas fund inflows are seen as the main challenges. Foreign funds bought more than $17 billion worth of Indian equities in 2007,
  as at Dec. 28, a record for a single year. The 50-issue NSE index<.NSEI> ended 0.97 percent up at 6,138.60 points, finishing up 54.8
  percent for the year. STOCKS TO WATCH * Marksans Pharma Ltd

<HEADLINE>Taiwan's Chen sees jump in China missile build-up</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  TAIPEI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian said on Tuesday China now had 1,328 ballistic missiles aimed at the self-ruled
  island, up by more than a third from a previous estimate, further threatening stability in the Taiwan Strait. In his final New Year's Day
  address before stepping down in May, Chen said the number of short-range ballistic missiles deployed against Taiwan had proliferated from
  200 in 2000, when he took office, and now exceeded his most recent estimate of 988. Taiwan has been ruled separately from China since 1949
  when Mao Zedong's Communists won a civil war on the mainland. Beijing still claims sovereignty over the democratically ruled island of 23
  million people and has threatened war if it formally moves towards independence. Chen railed against China's growing military threat,
  saying its People's Liberation Army had already finalised plans for an invasion and planned to push out the bounds of its airspace. 'In
  addition to setting in motion a three-stage plan for its People's Liberation Army to invade Taiwan, Beijing is poised to designate an 'air
  defence identification zone' in the Taiwan Strait and open a new civil air route along the median of the Taiwan Strait,' said Chen. 'In
  doing so, China is once again challenging and attempting to unilaterally change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait,' he added. Chen has
  previously said that the three-stage plan includes establishing combat preparedness for contingencies in the Strait by 2007, ensuring
  capabilities for large-scale engagements by 2010 and being ready to ensure a decisive victory over Taiwan by 2015. The president again
  defended his plan to hold a referendum on seeking the island's entry into the United Nations under the name 'Taiwan' alongside
  presidential elections in March. The plan has angered both Beijing and Washington, the island's key ally. 'This is an expression of our
  people's will. Referendum is a basic right guaranteed by law ... China utterly opposes referendum, democracy, and respect for human

<HEADLINE>WRAPUP 3-US candidates hone message; Huckabee pulls ad</HEADLINE>
<CONTENT>
  (Adds Iowa poll paragraphs 7-8) By Deborah Charles PERRY, Iowa, Dec 31 (Reuters) - White House hopefuls honed their closing messages and
  traded jabs over their records in Iowa on Monday, three days before the state opens the presidential nominating battle in a
  too-close-to-call race. The leading contenders in both parties traded shots as a tight Iowa campaign ticked down to the end. Republican
  Mike Huckabee said he would not air an advertisement he prepared attacking rival Mitt Romney -- then showed it to reporters. Democrat
  Hillary Clinton said she was better suited to tackle special interests in Washington than rival John Edwards, a former North Carolina
  senator who has made that issue the centerpiece of his campaign. 'It's easy to talk about taking on special interests,' the New York
  senator and former first lady said in Keokuk, Iowa. 'I've taken on the oil companies and I intend to keep doing it. It's something you
  don't have to do by yelling and screaming. Save your energy. Get the job done.' Polls show tight races in both parties in Iowa, which
  kicks off the state-by-state battle to choose candidates in the November presidential election. A Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll gave Clinton,
  seeking to be the first woman U.S. president, a four-point lead among Democrats over Edwards and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, who were tied
  for second. A separate Des Moines Register poll found Obama was the choice of 32 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers, up from 28
  percent in late November, while Clinton held steady at 25 percent and Edwards was virtually unchanged at 24 percent. The newspaper found
  32 percent support for Mike Huckabee among Republicans, followed by Romney with 26 percent. MOST ELECTABLE IN NOVEMBER The Democratic
  caucuses -- in which people gather in locations around the state to publicly declare support for their choices -- begin at 6:30 p.m.
  CST/0030 GMT on Thursday and Republicans start 30 minutes later. Results begin appearing within a few hours. All of the top Democrats
  argued they would be the most electable in the November 2008 election, and targeted undecided voters as they geared up mammoth operations
  to get out the vote on Thursday. 'If you will stand with me on January 3 and caucus with me, we can change the world,' Obama told a crowd
  in Perry in central Iowa. Polls showed many Iowans in both parties were undecided or open to changing their minds. A Democratic caucus
  rule allowing supporters of candidates who fail to gather 15 percent of support in a given precinct to switch to another candidate
  increased the uncertainty. 'FLUID RACE' 'There is a remarkable amount of fluidity in this race right now and a lot of undecideds,' David
  Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager, told reporters. He said all signs pointed to a large Democratic turnout on Thursday, which could be
  good for Obama and his effort to attract first-time caucus participants. The record Democratic turnout in 2004 was just more than 120,000.
  Romney has spent the last few days airing ads attacking Huckabee's record on immigration, taxes and crime in Arkansas. Huckabee, a Baptist
  minister, has fired back with questions about Romney's honesty and suitability for the White House. But he said he decided not to air a
  television ad that he prepared on Sunday in hopes of making the campaign more positive but then showed a

  MUMBAI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Indian newspapers carried the following stories in their print or Web editions on Tuesday. Reuters has not
  verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. BUSINESS STANDARD (www.business-standard.com) * Coir and coir products
  exports rose 20.47 percent by volume in Apr-Nov 2007 to 118,158 tonnes. However, in value terms, the rise was only 2.5 percent at 3.87
  billion rupees. * India's coffee exports in 2007 fell by 11.2 percent to 222,000 tonnes compared with 250,000 tonnes in 2006 as a rising
  rupee made Indian coffee less competitive and on poor overseas demand, according to the Coffee Board. * Wholesale potato prices have
  crashed by an average 40-50 percent to 260-425 rupees a quintal in various spot markets over the last one month due to fresh arrivals of
  the rabi, or winter, crop. FINANCIAL EXPRESS (www.financialexpress.com) * India's cashew exports fell by 11 percent in the first eight
  months of 2007/08 and traders expect lower exports in the later part of the financial year on poor consumption. Looking for more
